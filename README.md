# Final Project

This repository contains the data analysis project, completed by Riena Asakawa and Alfizza Khalfani Kenaz. The project focuses on cleaning, wrangling, and analyzing datasets related to global indicators, such as country codes and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Description

The project aims to explore global indicators through statistical and computational methods. It involves:

- Cleaning and transforming datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis.
- Generating insights and visualizations.

### Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, renaming columns, and reordering for clarity.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical techniques using R libraries.
- **Visualization**: Creating plots and summary tables to convey findings effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries**:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `knitr`
  - `broom`

## Files in the Repository

- `Project - Analysis (Final).Rmd`: Main R Markdown file containing the analysis.
- `country_codes.csv`: Dataset with country codes and regions.
- `country_indicators.csv`: Dataset with country indicators.
- (Add more files if needed).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have R installed on your system along with the required libraries:

```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "knitr", "broom"))
```

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sta130-project.git
   ```

2. Open the R Markdown file (`Project - Analysis (Final).Rmd`) in RStudio.

3. Run the code chunks sequentially to execute the analysis.

4. Knit the document to generate a PDF report.

## Project Outputs

- **Cleaned Data**: Ready-to-use datasets after cleaning and wrangling.
- **Visualizations**: Informative plots and charts summarizing key insights.
- **Report**: A comprehensive PDF report detailing the analysis.
